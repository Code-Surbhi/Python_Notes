'''
    Low level Language -> Machine Language and assembly language
    High level Language -> General Purpose, Special Purpose, Scripting Language

    General Purpose language -> Strict rules and syntax , C, C++, C# , Java , Python
    Special Purpose language -> WebDev , MobileDev , Developing Games , android , ios
    Scripting -> Easier to write and understand and learn

    HLL-> 
        1. Compiler based -> c, c++
        2. Interpreter based -> php , js
        3. Hybrid -> python , java , c#.net

    Compiler -> 
        Sorce code should not have any error
        Compiler is faster than interpreter -> complete machine code is made , translation done only once '

    Interpreter->
        Interpreter languages are more flexible as they provide runtime environment (Browser provides a R.E for js)
        Seperate file is note made here
        Translation is done everytime it runs
        Line by line translate and execute and then it moves to the next line 
    
    Hybrid ->
    Source Code(program.py) --compiler--> Byte Code(program.pyc) --interpreter--> Code runs
    program.pyc -> error free because the compiler checks if it has no error
    PVM -> python virtual machine -> Runtime environment of python
    Interpreter -> Line by line + aek sath -> because of pyc -> done by JIT compiler (just in time)

    Python -> Platform independent and portable
        sourceCode (program.py) --compiler--> bytecode (program.pyc) -> this pyc file can run on mac machine , linux , windows , everywhere (because of PVM)
        PVM -> every OS will have its own version of PVM
    
        on the contrary -> 
        First.c --compiler--> first.exe -> windows pe run hojayega but not on linux -> it will have to be recompiled here 
        First.js --interpreter--> Windows and linux (it will run on both) -> interpreter based languages are also platform independent

    Program -> Data and Instructions

    Paradigm / Style of programming ->
        1. Funtional / Procedural Programming -> function specific
            Funtion -> a set of instructions/code that performs specific tasks
            fun1() fun2() fun3() -> data1

        2.Object Oriented Programming -> 
            Data Centric and in OOPs we create objects of these classes and use them 

            Class A -> fun1() fun2() fun3() -> data1
            Class B -> f1() f2() f3()

        3.Modular Programming -> broken down into modules
            Date and time Module -> Class Date , Class TIme , funToday()
            Employee Module -> Class Module , Class Attendace , funSalary()

    Features of Python ->
    1. Easy to learn
    2. Simple/Expressive
    3.Scripting Language
    4.Open source
    5. General purpose
    6. Interpreter Langauge(Hybrid)
    7. Platform Independent
    8. Portable
    9. Dynamically types
    10. Object Oriented and procedural
    11. Extensive libraries
    12.Extensible -> c,c++ ke sath bhi hum use kar sakte hai
    13.Embeddable -> java mai use ho sakta hai
    14.Scalable

    1.Learn about core python 
    2.Then choose the interested area -> e.g learn about AI
    3.Then learn the library provided by that language
